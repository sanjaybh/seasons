What is Redux ?


What is the need of Redux


Why Rexux with React



#1. Have a single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single Redux store.
One application State object managed by one store


#2. State is read-only:

The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.


#3. To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers
